# Design Pickle Code Challenge

Thanks for applying to Design Pickle!

We'd love to learn about how you work / write code, but we value your time and understand that you probably have to complete many coding challenges, so we'll try to keep this brief. We ask that you spend a few hours (no more than 5) on the following challenge. We want you to be able to show your skills and commitment to writing great code in a pressure-free setting (just like you will be doing for Design Pickle!). The goal of this is NOT to have a production-ready application. There are multiple ways you can show us your skills, as you will see below, all based on the Github API. Be sure to take into consideration how long it will take to complete your solution. Remember, this is about quality, not quantity, and we don't want you spending a whole day on this.

- We DO expect the final product to be a webpage (not just a console application).
- Please use Ruby version 2.6.0. It makes our job a million times easier. Thank you!

## The Challenge

Use Public Github API (https://developer.github.com/v3)

Build a rudimentary service to query the Rails repository (https://github.com/rails/rails) for the latest open, unassigned issues.

The service should provide the ability for the end user to do the following:

1. Filter the results by component (explained below)
2. Order the results by comment counts (ie. most commented to least, least to most)

As well as anything else your implementation needs.

## Rails Components

In the repository, the Rails team uses labels to define the components of the stack the issues relate to.  The components we'd like you to get issues for are:

- ActionCable
- ActionMailer
- ActionPack
- ActionView
- ActiveJob
- ActiveModel
- ActiveRecord
- ActiveStorage
- ActiveSupport
- Asset Pipeline

Feel free to ignore the other labels.

## Preparing to submit
- Write a README - this should explain what you implemented (high level)
- Include a `.ruby-version` file
- Please don't put your solution on Github. We don't want our candidates to be able to see each other's work and the history of the project. Please take your entire directory, and zip or tarball it for submission.

## Whats next?
After you submit your solution, we'll review your code to see what you implemented and how you did it. We will use this to gauge your coding abilities and as a starting point for the next interview - a pairing session with our lead engineer.

For the pairing session, be prepared to:

- Talk about any of the complex parts of your solution, why you solved things a certain way, and what challenges you faced.
- Modify your code as a pair and screenshare a functional local version of your app
- Go through your resum√© and answer questions about your career path
